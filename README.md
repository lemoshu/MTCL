# Mean-Teacher-Assisted Confident Learning (MTCL)
- Implementation of our [paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-87193-2_1) "Noisy Labels are Treasure: Mean-Teacher-Assisted Confident Learning for Hepatic Vessel Segmentation" (2D version).    
- [Note] We are working on an extended version, 3D version and other datasets will be included. This's an initial report, code will be further re-organized but the core implementation is included that can be easily adapted to your own dataset. The preprocessed 2D hepatic data and other simulated 3D datasets will be available after journal publication. Stay tuned!
